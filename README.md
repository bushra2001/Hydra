# HYDRA:
Hydra is a very basic personalized P2P (Peer to Peer) blockchain network.

## Tools:
It is implemented using;
- Nodejs
- Visual Studio Code

## Functionalities:
This network is capable of doing following:

- Send and receive messages and include blocks in these messages.
- Register and unregister miners using PoS consensus mechanism.
- Create new blocks and sent them between the peers.
- Store blocks using name-value LevelDB database. 

## Communication:
In this project, I have also created a wallet, that consists of private-public key pairs.
Hydra communicate via API services and the CLI.
